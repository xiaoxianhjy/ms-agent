# Structure & Layering
Guidelines for clean, shallow section hierarchy.

## Overview
Control outline depth so the report reads like an analyst note, not an academic paper.
Keep structures simple, readable, and coherent.
Use this shallow hierarchy as the default template; only exceed it in rare, task-specific cases

## Core Rules
- **Default to 2–3 heading levels** (Chapter → Section → Subsection).
- Avoid trivial micro-sections that don’t add structural value. Short, necessary sections (e.g., risk disclaimer) are acceptable.
- Use **natural paragraphs** for flow; don’t fragment text excessively.
- Keep a typical pattern: Summary → Core Analysis → Forecast → Risks → Conclusion.

## Do
- Use headings only for meaningful topic shifts.
- Merge closely related content.
- Maintain internal narrative continuity.

## Don’t
- Don’t use deep hierarchies (1.2.3.4.5).
- Don’t repeat identical background across sections.
- Don’t make bullet-only sections.

## Checklist
- [ ] ≤3 levels used
- [ ] No redundant micro-sections
- [ ] Narrative flows smoothly
