# Task Focus & Relevance
Keep the report anchored to the user’s specific question.

## Overview
Avoid drifting into long industry essays.
Ensure all content serves the **company-scope-time window** defined by the task.

## Core Rules
- Tie every major section to one or more core analytical dimensions required by the task (e.g., profitability, growth, cash flow, competition, risk, or forecast).
- Minimize repeated or irrelevant background.
- Avoid policy histories or macro digressions unless directly relevant.
- When macro/policy factors are mentioned, immediately link them to specific company metrics or trend changes in the defined time window.

## Do
- Restate the task in the introduction.
- Explicitly link each section to the target companies/time frame.
- Consolidate industry/macro background into **one short background subsection** (e.g., 1–2 paragraphs in the introduction).
- When later sections need background, **reuse it in one sentence and reference the earlier subsection** (e.g., “As noted in Section 1.1, …”) instead of rewriting the full context.

## Don’t
- Don’t include unrelated macro/policy background.
- Don’t duplicate the same context across chapters.

## Checklist
- [ ] Each section can be explained in one sentence how it serves the task.
- [ ] Background concise and non-repetitive
- [ ] No scope creep
