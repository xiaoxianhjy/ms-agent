# Bullets & Paragraph Rhythm
Balance bullet lists and narrative flow.

## Overview
Bullets structure lists; paragraphs carry reasoning.
Over-bulleted text reads robotic; insufficient bullets reduces clarity.

## Core Rules
- Use bullets for **drivers, risks, assumptions, KPIs**.
- Keep explanations and transitions in paragraphs.
- Avoid long sections made only of bullets.

## Do
- Precede/follow bullet lists with short paragraphs (2–4 sentences).
- Use bullets only when enumerating items.

## Don’t
- Don’t place every sentence in a bullet.
- Don’t create sections that contain only a single short bullet point without explanation.

## Checklist
- [ ] Bullets only where listing is appropriate
- [ ] Reasoning remains in prose
- [ ] Bullet sections are not excessively long
