# Density & Length Control
Maintain high information value with minimal redundancy.

## Overview
Long reports risk redundancy.
This spec ensures conciseness without losing analytical depth.

## Core Rules
- Prioritize high-signal content directly related to profitability, cash flows, competition, and forecasts
  (e.g., margins, key drivers, valuation, competitive moves).
- Compress low-value background while keeping essential macro/policy factors that affect conclusions.
- One main idea per paragraph; supporting evidence can stay in the same paragraph.

## Do
- Summarize background when necessary instead of narrating it in full.
- Consolidate similar facts into a single, high-density paragraph or table.
- Prune paragraphs that don’t change conclusions, risk assessment, or forecasts.

## Don’t
- Don’t repeat identical information across chapters unless it is a deliberate recap in the executive summary or conclusion.
- Don’t include irrelevant company history or generic industry description.
- Don’t let sections balloon in length without new insights or decision-relevant facts.

## Checklist
- [ ] No unnecessary repetition of facts across sections (brief recaps in summary/conclusion are allowed)
- [ ] Each paragraph adds analytical or decision-relevant value
- [ ] Section length is proportional to its importance for the investment view
