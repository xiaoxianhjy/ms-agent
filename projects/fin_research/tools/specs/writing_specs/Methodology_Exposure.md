# Methodology Exposure
Control how frameworks appear in reports.

## Overview
Analyst reports should **use** frameworks implicitly, not **discuss** them like a textbook.

## Core Rules
- As a rule of thumb, mention methodology at most once in the main text, and keep it brief.
- Only add extra clarification in footnotes or appendices when strictly necessary (e.g., for data sources or backtests).
- No standalone “Methodology” chapters.
- Avoid repeated naming of MECE / SWOT / 80-20 / Value Chain.
- Emphasize **conclusions and drivers**, not analytical process.

## Do
- Use frameworks silently to organize logic.
- Introduce the approach in 1 sentence if needed.

## Don’t
- Don't describe frameworks in detail.
- Don’t repeatedly cite them or make them focal content.

## Checklist
- [ ] Frameworks named ≤1 time in the main text
- [ ] No method-focused chapters
- [ ] Focus stays on results, not process
