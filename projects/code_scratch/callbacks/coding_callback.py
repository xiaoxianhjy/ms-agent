The PRD of this project:

{messages[2].content}

Strictly follow the steps:

1. Before writing each file, list the imports of all code files under your responsibility and read the implementations first, to compatible with other code files.

```
The A file depends on the B and C file, and D on the css format, I should read them:
```

If any dependencies do not exist, create them.

2. Read the target code file itself to prevent a break change to the existing files.

You may read several files in step1 and step2, this is good to understand the project,
you may read other files if necessary, like config files or package files to enhance your understanding.

3. Output your code with this format:

```type: filename
text
```

for example:
```javascript: frontend/index.js
your code here
```

The `frontend/index.js` will be used to saving. Therefore, you must generate it strictly in this format.

4. Do not let your code silent crash, make the logs shown in the running terminal, later the compiling process can feedback these issues to you.

5. Do not leave the images blank, you don't have any local assets(neither images nor logos), use image links from unsplash
    * Do not generate icos or pngs, always import from unsplash

6. Here is an extra instruction of making your website beautiful:

    * **Overall Style:** Consider magazine-style, publication-style, or other modern web design styles you deem appropriate. The goal is to create a page that is both informative and visually appealing, like a well-designed digital magazine or in-depth feature article.

    * **Hero Section (Optional but Strongly Recommended):** If you think it's appropriate, design an eye-catching Hero section. It can include a main headline, subtitle, an engaging introductory paragraph, and a high-quality background image or illustration.

    * **Typography:**
      * Carefully select font combinations (serif and sans-serif) to enhance the reading experience.
      * Use different font sizes, weights, colors, and styles to create a clear visual hierarchy.
      * Consider using refined typographic details (such as drop caps, hanging punctuation) to enhance overall quality.
      * Font Awesome has many icons - choose appropriate ones to add visual interest and playfulness.

    * **Color Scheme:**
      * Choose a color palette that is both harmonious and visually impactful.
      * Consider using high-contrast color combinations to highlight important elements.
      * Explore gradients, shadows, and other effects to add visual depth.

    * **Layout:**
      * Use a grid-based layout system to organize page elements.
      * Make full use of negative space (whitespace) to create visual balance and breathing room.
      * Consider using cards, dividers, icons, and other visual elements to separate and organize content.

    * **Tone:** Overall style should be refined, creating a sense of sophistication.

    * **Data Visualization:**
      * Design one or more data visualization elements to showcase key concepts of Naval's thinking and their relationships.
      * Consider using mind maps, concept relationship diagrams, timelines, or thematic clustering displays.
      * Ensure visualization design is both beautiful and insightful, helping users intuitively understand the overall framework of Naval's thought system.
      * Use Mermaid.js to implement interactive charts that allow users to explore connections between different concepts.

    **Technical Specifications:**

    *   Use HTML5、Font Awesome、Tailwind CSS and necessary JavaScript。
        *   Font Awesome: [https://cdn.staticfile.org/font-awesome/6.4.0/css/all.min.css](https://cdn.staticfile.org/font-awesome/6.4.0/css/all.min.css)
        *   Tailwind CSS: [https://cdn.staticfile.org/tailwindcss/2.2.19/tailwind.min.css](https://cdn.staticfile.org/tailwindcss/2.2.19/tailwind.min.css)
        *   Font for non-Chinese: [https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Serif+SC:wght@400;500;600;700&family=Noto+Sans+SC:wght@300;400;500;700&display=swap](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Serif+SC:wght@400;500;600;700&family=Noto+Sans+SC:wght@300;400;500;700&display=swap)
        *   `font-family: Tahoma,Arial,Roboto,"Droid Sans","Helvetica Neue","Droid Sans Fallback","Heiti SC","Hiragino Sans GB",Simsun,sans-self;`
        *   Mermaid: [https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@latest/dist/mermaid.min.js](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@latest/dist/mermaid.min.js)

    * Implement a complete dark/light mode toggle functionality that follows system settings by default and allows users to manually switch.
    * Code structure should be clear and semantic, including appropriate comments.
    * Implement complete responsiveness that must display perfectly on all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
