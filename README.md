## Installation

### Install from PyPI

```shell
pip install ms-agent
```


### Install from source

```shell
git clone https://github.com/modelscope/ms-agent.git

cd ms-agent
pip install -e .
```



> [!WARNING]
> As the project has been renamed to `ms-agent`, for versions `v0.8.0` or earlier, you can install using the following command:
> ```shell
> pip install modelscope-agent<=0.8.0
> ```
> To import relevant dependencies using `modelscope_agent`:
> ``` python
> from modelscope_agent import ...
> ```


## Quickstart

### Using MCP
This project supports interaction with models via the MCP (Model Context Protocol). Below is a complete example showing
how to configure and run an LLMAgent with MCP support.

✅ Chat with agents using the MCP protocol: [MCP Playground](https://modelscope.cn/mcp/playground)

By default, the agent uses ModelScope's API inference service. Before running the agent, make sure to set your
ModelScope API key.
```bash
export MODELSCOPE_API_KEY={your_modelscope_api_key}
```
You can find or generate your API key at https://modelscope.cn/my/myaccesstoken.

```python
from ms_agent import LLMAgent
import asyncio

# Configure MCP server
mcp = {
    "mcpServers": {
        "fetch": {
            "type": "sse",
            "url": "https://{your_mcp_url}.api-inference.modelscope.net/sse"
        }
    }
}

async def main():
    # Initialize the agent with MCP configuration
    llm_agent = LLMAgent(mcp_config=mcp)
    # Run a task
    await llm_agent.run('Briefly introduce modelscope.cn')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Launch the async main function
    asyncio.run(main())
```
----
💡 Tip: You can find available MCP server configurations at modelscope.cn/mcp.

For example: https://modelscope.cn/mcp/servers/@modelcontextprotocol/fetch.
Replace the url in `mcp["mcpServers"]["fetch"]` with your own MCP server endpoint.


### Agentic Insight

#### - Lightweight, Efficient, and Extensible Multi-modal Deep Research Framework

This project provides a framework for **Deep Research**, enabling agents to autonomously explore and execute complex tasks.

#### 📺 Demonstration

Here is a demonstration of the Agentic Insight framework in action, showcasing its capabilities in handling complex research tasks efficiently.

- **User query**

- - Chinese:

```text
在计算化学这个领域，我们通常使用Gaussian软件模拟各种情况下分子的结构和性质计算，比如在关键词中加入'field=x+100'代表了在x方向增加了电场。但是，当体系是经典的单原子催化剂时，它属于分子催化剂，在反应环境中分子的朝向是不确定的，那么理论模拟的x方向电场和实际电场是不一致的。

请问：通常情况下，理论计算是如何模拟外加电场存在的情况？
```

- - English:
```text
In the field of computational chemistry, we often use Gaussian software to simulate the structure and properties of molecules under various conditions. For instance, adding 'field=x+100' to the keywords signifies an electric field applied along the x-direction. However, when dealing with a classical single-atom catalyst, which falls under molecular catalysis, the orientation of the molecule in the reaction environment is uncertain. This means the x-directional electric field in the theoretical simulation might not align with the actual electric field.

So, how are external electric fields typically simulated in theoretical calculations?
